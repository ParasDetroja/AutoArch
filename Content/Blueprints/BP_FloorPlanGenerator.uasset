This is a binary file that would contain the Blueprint asset for the Floor Plan Generator UI.
The Blueprint would expose the following functionality:
- Input field for selecting floor plan texture
- Sliders for wall height (default: 300cm / 10ft)
- Sliders for door height (default: 244cm / 8ft) 
- Sliders for window height (default: 152cm / 5ft)
- Slider for wall thickness (default: 10cm / 4in)
- "Generate Structure" button
- Progress bar for generation process
- Options for material selection

This Blueprint would create a UFloorPlanProcessor instance and call ProcessFloorPlan() with the configured parameters.
